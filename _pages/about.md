**Associate Professor/Research Professor**

*Computer Science Department*  
*Center for Energy-efficient Computing and Applications (CECA)*  
*Peking University*  
*Room 518, Science Building No.5, Yiheyuan Rd No.5, Beijing, 100871*

I am an Associate Professor (with tenure) in the Department of Computer Science and Technology at Peking University and a member of Center for Energy-efficient Computing and Applications (CECA). My research interests include computer architecture, compiler, electronics design automation, embedded system design, and high-performance computing. My recent publications investigate new algorithms, programming models, compiler optimization and tool-chain, design tools and methodologies, and hardware for high-performance and energy-efficient computer systems. I have authored over ninety scientific publications in the leading international journals and conferences. My research has been recognized with two Best Paper Awards (FCCM 2011 and ICCAD 2017), six Best Paper Award Nominations (PPoPP 2019, DAC 2017, ASPDAC 2016, DAC 2012, FPT 2011, CODES+ISSS 2008), the Beijing Natural Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars (2019), and Beijing Academy of Artificial Intelligence (BAAI) Young Scientist Award. I received the Excellence Teaching Award from Peking University in 2017. My research has been funded by NSFC, BNSF, SenseTime, Alibaba, etc. I am currently the Director of PKU-SenseTime Joint Lab of Intelligent Computing.

I currently serve as Associate Editor of the ACM Transactions on Embedded Computing Systems (TECS) and Associate Editor of IEEE Embedded Systems Letters. I was the program chair of 30th Annual IEEE International Conference on Application-specific Systems, Architecture and Processors (ASAP) 2019 and the subcommittee chair of Asia South Pacific Design Automation Conference (ASPDAC) 2014. I also serve in the program committees in the premier conferences including DAC, ICCAD, DATE, ASPDAC, FPGA, FCCM, HPCA, ASPLOS, ISCA, PPoPP, PACT, CGO, ICS, CC, CASES, LCTES, ASAP, and ICCD. Prior to joining Peking University, I received my Ph.D in Computer Science from National University of Singapore in 2010. Upon graduation, I worked as a Research Scientist in UIUC. 

## To Perspective Postdocs, Students, and Interns

I am looking for highly motivated graduate students, postdocs, and interns to work on system research including algorithms, programming language, compiler, embedded systems, and electronic design automation. Students with strong hands-on system building skills and algorithm background are especially welcomed.
